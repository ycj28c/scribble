Hi, it is me. How do you do? Fine, thank you, and you?

I like playing computer games, when the year Ms-DOS, pc are still using 3.5 inches disk, I was starting to play game. so far, I have played more than 3 thousand games. some one ask me why i call Ralph, It is from the game King Of Fight. my fariote charactor in that game is called ralf, he is very strong but easy to use, I only have to press the key ralf punch, the I win the game. That's where I name myself, we have to fight for the life, fight for futher, right, but keep it simple and enjoy it.

I also like travel and challege. I remember one time i was travelling to Bali, there is a private beach, the tour guide warn us there are no coast guard, so be careful if you swim. I was born near the ocean, so I never afraid of swimming. I jumped into water and swin forward. 10 mins later, I look back, I was 30 meters away from the second guy. I was happy, but after that, I realize a problem, How I go back? we know the ocean wave is back and forward, and that beach is famous because of the big ocean wave. I tried to swim back, but I quited because I have no energy to fight with the wave. I have to change the strategy, when the wave come to me, I hold breath and dive in the water, when the wave push, I swim. It is extrodinally hard even to move a meter distance. finally, my foot can touch the land, when I arrive the coast, I was totally exhosted.
