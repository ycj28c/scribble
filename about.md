Hi, it is me. How do you do? Fine, thank you, and you? Emmm, that was the sentence in our English learning book.

I like playing computer games, back to the Ms-DOS days, when the PCs were still struggling with 3.5 inches disk, the computer games became part of my life. So far, I have played more than 3 thousand games. The idea of my English name Ralph also from the game, It is actually from the game King Of Fight, my fariote charactor there was called Ralf, he was a very powerful man and surprisingly super easy to use, basically I only need to press one key to release Ralf punch, then win the game, simple and crude (My teacher told me there was no name called Ralf in English world, what?! I have to choose Ralph as alternaive). Indeed, that's the life style I am looking for, keep fighting, but try to make it simple and enjoy it.

I also the fan of tourism and challege. Emmm, well, I could not forgot one time I was travelling to Bali of Indonesia, there was a private beach, the tourist guide warned us the waves of that beach were fierce, and there were no lifeguard, be careful if you want to swim. The thought came to my mind at that moment was: I was born next to ocean, every kids in my hometown know how to swim, I was not even pay attention when heard the warning. Later I stepped into water and started swin forward... 10 mins later, when I looked back, I was the one farthest to the shore, no one close by except bird, even the second far guy was around 20 meters away from me. I was proud at beginning, but suddenly, I realized a serious problem, How can I go back? As we know, the ocean wave was like back and forward, in addition that beach was famous because of the big ocean wave. Immediately, I tried to swim back. However, the resistance was much stronger than I imaged, swin out was like smearing oil, but swimming back just felt like an invisible hand was pulling you back. I stop swimming because I quickly consumed all energy fighting with the wave. Need to change the strategy right away, when the wave rush to deep sea, I hold breath and dived in the water, when the wave crash to shore, I followed wave flow. It was extrodinally hard even to move a meter distance, because when you saw the body getting close to shore, next moment the wave took back to the sea again, helpless, fear continue attacking my mind... Finally, my foot can feel something solid, the hope came back to me. I was totally exhosted when I arrived the shore. I laid on the familar land, breathing the air greedily like an elephant, the sunshine never that warm, the blue sky never that beatiful in my whole life. 

Awe of nature, and, every day is beatiful even it is a very normal day.
