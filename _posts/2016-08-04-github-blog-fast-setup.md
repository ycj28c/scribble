After I setup this Github blog, I tried establish another blog in Gihub for other purpose, I found create a blog is much easier than I did before. All the operation you can do online in Github.

QuickStart
----------
Here is the QuickStart about initial the Blog in website

1. Folk a Jekyll site project to your Github repo, such as [Scribbe Link](https://github.com/muan/scribble)
2. Go into your folk project - Settings - raname Repository name
3. When Settings - Github Pages display " Your site is published at https://xxxx.github.io/", means success published your blog
4. Now you can navigate to https://xxxx.github.io, simple and easy

Suggestion
----------
The https://youraccount.github.io is the Github blog defautl page, it has exact permission, thus it can display the JavaScript or CSS from external source. It is unlimited space, so it means we can use blog as a online file server(not recommand, the purpose is for blog). What need to do is set the Repository name to youraccount.github.io.
