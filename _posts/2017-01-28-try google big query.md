Try BigQuery
============
Google Big Query is a tool, you can use it as same as use the SQL query, super easy to use. Means you don't need knowledge about programming or technical, can directly use it like marketing people. Google has prepared all the data sets you want, they only charge when you query. Well, I runed a simple query, the google told me I have use 24GB data. Every month has 1 TB free data, but actrually it only enough for one big query run.

How to try
------------
* Go to https://bigquery.cloud.google.com
* Create a project
* Choose the data set
* Run a Query Table

I did a run for github, query example: https://gist.github.com/arfon/49ca314a5b0a00b1ebf91167db3ff02c#most-commonly-used-go-packages

It only took 7.6 seconds for 23.6GB, is fast enough to meet my expectation.

Thinks
------
I didn't going deep into it, but I already feel the value of Big Query. The core is "DATA", when we have github data, we can research which language is most popular, the trend of the projects. When we have stock data, we can check what changes happened to company stock suddenly went up etc. It is all about "Big Data", the point is not about how fast we get the result, the point is when Google have all area of data, what they can do after. Very possibly they can calculate the future accoss the different areas data, when Big Data collapse with AI, how large spark we will see.
